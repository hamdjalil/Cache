# Cache
Implementation of Cache in C++.
- A double linked list is used as the cache with elements as vectors.
- dynamic arrays are used as an alternative to std::map with can be indexed for retrieval in O(1) time.
- arrays contain type Nodes i.e they contain node adresses which can be used for  deletion in O(1) time as well.
- Insertion is performed by adding data to the head of linked list hence O(1) time complexity.
